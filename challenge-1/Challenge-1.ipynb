    "Create a working interactive *program* (it can be a website, game, app, etc.) in which a human user is facing off against a quantum computer. This is broad on purpose – the program can be built in many different ways. Your program should implement strategies that seriously challenge the human player. The implementation must utilize more than just probabilities related to measuring quantum states. You must use Qiskit to program the computer’s gameplay strategy, and as much as possible, the strategy should be implemented with quantum circuits and quantum gates on real quantum hardware or the simulator."
